#Here, we use the modulo operator to find the remainder of division operations. We see that 29 % 5 equals 4, 32 % 3 equals 2, and 44 % 2 equals 0.
#Letâ€™s look at another example to get a better idea of how modulo is useful in programming:

print(3 % 3) # Prints 0
print(4 % 3) # Prints 1
print(5 % 3) # Prints 2
print(6 % 3) # Prints 0
print(7 % 3) # Prints 1
